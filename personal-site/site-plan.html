      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I am Jarom Mariscal, I am a full-stack developer.
        And this is my portfolio. 
        About me
        I love programming and computers, I discovered this passion when I was a secondary student, I always made question about how to work the computers. In highschool, I learned to program and I participated in programming conquests; I had the opportunity to create a Programming club in my high school for those students who wanted to learn. 
        My hobbies are reading books, my favorite book is The hobbit, and drawing pictures in my notebook. My favorite sport is volleyball for that is so strategic and for Haykyuu. I love cats.

      </ul>
      <h3>Technologies and Skills</h3>
      <p>
        React
        It is a JavaScript library for web and native user interfaces. This uses a format calls JSX, to merge code HTML and JavaScript. It is based on Web Components, making it easy to recycle them and put their interactivity.
        This Framework is my favorite to use in the Front-end allows me to create user interfaces faster than if I make it in pure HTML 
        Java
        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. This language is multiplatform, meaning it can run on any device with a Java machine. 
        I use this language to learn new techniques and develop my logic. This was the third language I learned.
        Python
        Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively. It is so simple and easy to learn and use, its code is so similar to English. 
        Python is the first language that I learned and I use it with Django.
        PHP
        PHP is one of the most popular scripting languages on the internet. PHP is easier to learn, which is why it is so popular. It was my first backend programming language.
        I use it with Laravel, a popular framework to build websites, using MVC.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Weather App
        For this project, I use an API called weather-api.com, which shows the weather in whatever city.
        The requirements for this project were have that 
        I used Next js, a React Framework to create websites. Next js can divide the Server Components and Client Components, making the websiteâ€™s performance much better.
        Authentication App
        I make a backend to log in as a user and start a session. 
        I used PHP to log in and validate a user, and MySQL to create the database. I had that manage the routes for each request.
        Countries
        This website is designed to show information about the different countries, using a filter by continent, and a search bar.
        I used React to create the user interface, and JavaScript to filter the data.
