      <p>
        I am Jarom Mariscal, and I am a web developer and student from BYU Pathway Worldwide
        <br>
        <strong>About me</strong>
        One of the things that I love to do is programming, this is my passion, and currently, I am seeking a bachelor´s degree in Software development at BYU.
        I live in Sonora, Mexico, with my family composed of my parents and my four siblings.
        My favorite hobbies are reading books and drawing 
        <br>
        <strong>My life trajectory</strong>
        <br>
        Highschool
        <br>
        I began programming in high school. My first language was Python. Also in high school, I participated in Programming conquests, one of that is OSI, which is a state informatic conquest. After I participated in that conquest, I was among the best 15 in the state, I made a programming club in my school. Some of the members achieved to get better results and get into the national conquest.
        <br>
        Ecotoner
        <br>
        After returning from the mission, I was working in a local company called Ecotoner, as a computer technician. My principal tasks were fixing and giving maintenance to computers and printers. In this job I can develop several soft skills how are listening and teamwork.
        <br>
        Funval 
        <br>
        After Ecotoner I took a course from a foundation called FUNVAL, and become a web developer, In that course learned about the SCRUM methodology and technologies for frontend and backend development.

      </ul>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>
        I consider myself a self-learner and I love learning about programming. The next skills are several of my current capabilities that I have developed over the years of web development.
        <br>
        <strong>Front end skills</strong>
        For the part to develop the website on the client’s side or front end, I use the next tools to organize, stylize and add interactivity to the site.
        <br>
        <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>
        This is the basic for frontend, HTML to mark and organize the information, CSS to add styles to the site, and JavaScript to add control and interactivity, to manipulate the client events such as a click or resize the site. 
        <br>
        <strong>React JS</strong>
        React JS makes me easier to create and recycle components, instead to copy and paste the same code or create templates in HTML. Besides, React JS is reactive, and manages the states of the app and the components, allowing me to add special behaviors when the component appears or dismounts from the browser. 
        <br>
        <strong>Bootstrap y Tailwind</strong>
        Bootstrap and Tailwind are tools to add styles avoiding writing a lot of CSS, but that had already made the classes and styles for that. To be honest, I like better Tailwind than Bootstrap, because is more flexible to use, in exchange for Bootstrap is so static and restrictive, but a good point is that has components like cards, an images carousel, and so on to import.
        <br>
        <strong>Next JS</strong>
        Next JS is the most important React framework. This is so easy to use in the current version 13 with its new app routing. This works much the front end as the back end. 
        <br>
        <strong>Back end Skills</strong>
        The back end is the server side. This part works with the client’s requests, routing, database connection, user authentication, and other parts of the security of the website.  
        <br>
        <strong>PHP y MySQL</strong>
        PHP and MySQL work well together, so much so that PHP has special functions for MySQL. MySQL is the System to manage the database while PHP is responsible to manage the requests and the logic for the site  
        <br>
        <strong>Laravel</strong> 
        It is the framework for PHP. This has many tools to develop faster a web site.

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I have done several projects focusing on full-stack development, in this case, my projects are:
        <br>
        <strong>Countries Web:</strong> This project is a simple website that contains data from API called RestCountries API. This website was built in React JS, to create the components, and Native JavaScript to use the fetch API and the filters for the data.
        <br>
        <strong>Weather-APP:</strong> This website is a challenge from a devchallenges.io and contains a weather view for the cities in the world. This can get the current location and show the local weather using the weather API. This was built in the React framework, Next JS 13, which implements new features in website routing.  
        <br>
        <strong>University-app:</strong> This is a project that was assigned to me in the FUNVAL course for Final Project, this project consists of a CRUD for a university. This CRUD contains data about the teachers, courses, and students in that university, and I need to create a database, the backend system, and the view for the client. I created this system using Laravel, a PHP framework for this project.

      </ul>

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        In the section about me, I want to add more information and for that I put that text placeholder
      </p>
      <img src="./images/wireframe_home.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>         
        I divided in two sections, front end skills and backend skills, but in the future I want to add a section about
        other projects how apps or other things.
      </p>

        For this wireframe, in each image, I will put a hover effect when the user
        activates it, the information appears.
