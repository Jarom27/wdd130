                        <p>This is the basic for frontend, HTML to mark and organize the information, CSS to add styles to the site, and JavaScript to add control and interactivity, to manipulate the client events such as a click or resize the site. </p>

                        <h3>React JS</h3>
                        <p>React JS makes me easier to create and recycle components, instead to copy and paste the same code or create templates in HTML. Besides, React JS is reactive, and manages the states of the app and the components, allowing me to add special behaviors when the component appears or dismounts from the browser.</p>

                        <h3>Bootstrap y Tailwind</h3>
                        <p>Bootstrap and Tailwind are tools to add styles avoiding writing a lot of CSS, but that had already made the classes and styles for that. To be honest, I like better Tailwind than Bootstrap, because is more flexible to use, in exchange for Bootstrap is so static and restrictive, but a good point is that has components like cards, an images carousel, and so on to import.</p>

                        <p> Next JS is the most important React framework. This is so easy to use in the current version 13 with its new app routing. This works much the front end as the back end.</p>
